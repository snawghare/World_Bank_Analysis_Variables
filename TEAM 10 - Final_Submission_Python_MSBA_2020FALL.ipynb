    "\n",
    "For the Data Analysis Team Project, Team 10 has to work on data describing the Eastern European region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every country in Eastern Europe is famous for different culture and tradition, mostly the region is known for its grain production, specially wheat and its livestock. (1)\n",
    "The introduction focuses on the limitation of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes Eastern European-, Northern European-, as well as Southern European countries all defined as Eastern Europe. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the United Nations the following countries are classified as Eastern Europe: Belarus, Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine. (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple sources show strong differences between Eastern and Northern European countries listed in the given dataset together, which makes the evaluation of the data complicating. (3)\n",
    "Various statistics show the pioneering task of Norway, Sweden and Finland not only in Europe but also in the world. (4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in the dataset most of the values of Kosovo are missing, which is connected to the newly gained independency in 2008. To this day Kosovo gained diplomatic recognition as a sovereign state by 98 UN member states. (5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, numerous data of San Marino is lacking. San Marino is a tiny country which leads to missing relevant statistics like on HIV. Geographically the state is surrounded by Italy therefor the country shows numerous similarities with the Italian-speaking republic. (6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, Andorra disposes of multiple missing data. The landlocked Principality of Andorra is one of the smallest countries in Europe, which leads again to non-relevant data since the numbers are low. The country is located in between France and Spain, that generates the assumption that the data could be similar to France and especially Spain. Our research showed similar results. (7) \n"

    "\n",
    "--\tStrategy 1 : Excluding index where 50%+ of the values are missing. In such case, we eliminated the following 5 indicators:\n",
    "  \n",
    "   1.Literacy rate, adult total (% of people ages 15 and above) – 18  \n",
    "   out of 19 are missing.\n",

    "   3.Poverty gap at national poverty lines (Percent) – 17 out of 19 are\n",

    "   5.Reported cases of malaria – 19 out of 19 are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

    "Strategy 2: For the indicators which has 50 Percent + values exist, we went through the data on the World Bank site and fill in the blanks if there are associated existing recent numbers.\n",

    "After running the previous step we complete all the information from the remaining features on our region.\n",

    "In order to compare our region with the whole world, we need to also subset the Global Data. When we apply the same approach to the global Data, we still had some missing values. Therefore, we need to apply another strategy to deal with the remaining missing values\n",

    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategy 3: For the few missing values, we ran the histograms on selected variables as regional data for global values, and check if the Mean or the Median are closer to the middle part. We would adopt either one that is closer to the average to impute. \n",
